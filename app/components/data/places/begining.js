<p>
The curtain raises on a new adventure ...

I had already traveled a great distance, by plane, then river boat,
 and most recently in a beaten up old truck which rattled and banged along forest trails.
<p>
And now, the rough noise of the engine dwindles through thick follage, and I am left standing alone.
